# REM ~ Random Excuse Generator

Back in December 2012, I wanted to make a really simple php script that would output a random excuse. It's almost a joke thing in our office, who can come up with the silliest excuse to silly questions.

I literally spent hours looking at other scripts, reading StackOverflow or googling how to do such a thing before concocting a horrendous amount of code, which ultimately didn't work.

This evening, after a bit of reading up on PHP, I thought I'd give it another go...

8 minutes later, and REM is working, albeit very simply.
